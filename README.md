A (very) basic smart mirror platform written in Python. 

## About

A few years ago I built a smart mirror utilizing the [MagicMirrorÂ²](https://magicmirror.builders/) platform. It's worked great since and I couldn't be happier, but I needed a Python project to help solidify my understanding of the language. So, here we are. This README will be populated further as the project develops.
